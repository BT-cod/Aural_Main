                Did that vision terrify you, or seem like an unattainable cloud in the sky?
                <br>
                <br>
                Using techniques to improve your voice as a speaker is great, but what if the block on your path to pure
                charisma stemmed from your mind?
                Here’s a fact: you’re not alone.
                Stage fear, also terrifyingly known as stage phobia, is more common than anyone’s willing to admit. From
                high-level executives to the fittest athletes, there’s no economic or social boundary to the kind of
                people who dab their hankies at their foreheads when asked to speak with people looking on.
                To get to the root of this fear, you need to know where fear begins from.
                Let us tell you this: you’re not afraid of the stage, the board room, the ramp, or the lecture hall.
                You’re not afraid of the people in them either (though there’s always that scary professor/boss/Uncle
                Cynic). You’re not even afraid of getting it wrong. What you’re afraid of is the exaggerated, worst-case
                consequences of getting it wrong.
                <br>
                <br>
                To be afraid of unknown outcomes is only human, especially when we want that promotion, grade, or
                appreciation more than anything. We want to get it right. Things don’t always go right for everyone, and
                it’s scary to realize that it could be us.
                Fear in small doses is good. It helps us strive for our goals more or at the very least, survive. But
                when is it too much?
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Some say they’re afraid of committing an error so dreadfully wrong, that they’d never be able to face
                the world again. This, to many, isn’t an exaggeration or a joke to be laughed at. It is deep-rooted
                insecurity preventing the best of people from achieving their dreams.
                To understand why, if you feel this way, you’ll probably have to relive some traumatic memories. Think
                of the times you, as a child, did something you wanted to be appreciated for. It could be something as
                simple as drawing a picture, playing a part in your kindergarten skit, or reciting a poem before the
                class.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                What kind of people surrounded you as a child? Were those who had authority over you, like parents,
                grandparents, teachers, or your caregiver, supportive of what you had to show? When you tell yourself
                awful untruths, whose voice do you hear those words in? Your grim aunt or your second-grade teacher who
                told you you’d never make it? You don’t even have to be a child in your story. It could be your P.E.T.
                teacher when you were fourteen.
                Our inner demons, those voices inside us, are a result, a reflection of what we’ve been through in our
                past. It’s a pesky little monster that masquerades as the guardian that has your best interests at
                heart, only trying to keep you safe. Sounds like Mother Gothel from Rapunzel, doesn’t it?
            </p>

            <p>
                Trauma takes time, effort and forgiveness to unmask and undo. We promise you, it won’t be easy but it’ll
                sure be worth it.
                Still, it looks like some people generally have it easier than the rest of us. Actors, politicians,
                CEOs, and sports stars make a meme out of themselves one day and seem to move on with their lives the
                month next. Classmates walk up to random strangers to promote a club and deliver a killer presentation
                on the same day.
                The only thing these people have that you don’t do on the stage is practice. They’ve got practice of
                speaking the right way and overcoming the limiting beliefs that tell them they can’t do it.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Here’s the billion-dollar question: how do you overcome your limiting beliefs?</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                Step one, unpack. Unpack those memory boxes that keep playing the unpleasant things that aren’t going to
                happen. Throw away that voice box that keeps telling you that you can’t do it. Because you sure as heck
                can. Let that sink in.
                <br>
                <br>
                Step two, start small. Start singing, joking or pitching before those who love you and are willing to
                help you grow. Aim for a little more people at your next song or one new stranger every month. Kenny
                Sebastian didn’t turn into a comedy champ overnight.
                <br>
                <br>
                Step three, know that if something wrong does happen, you’ll figure out a way to handle it, and it’ll
                pass. Believe in yourself to do it right and handle the errors.
                <br>
                <br>
                Step four, everyone is human. This is the most important reminder most of us forget. Most people have
                the same fears, insecurities and fallibility as you do. No one is out there to judge your mistakes and
                certainly to remember them, and the few that unfortunately do, have inner work to do themselves. Forgive
                and embrace yourself for being the human you.
                <br>
                <br>
                Step five, there’s nothing else. That’s it. Not as simple as it sounds bit not as hard as you think.
                <br>
                <br>
