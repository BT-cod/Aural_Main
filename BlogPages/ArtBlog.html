                go-to activity when you’re bored? Did your answers include listening to music or watching shows/videos?
                Needless to say, you’re not the only one. Try imagining a week with no music. No series to binge watch
                on the weekend. No videos or podcasts to keep your mind occupied. Infuriating, isn't it? Despite
                actively consuming various kinds of media for entertainment, most of us fail to understand and
                appreciate the artists and their omnipresent work.

                Art produces emotion in people. An upbeat song can lift your mood. Resonating with a fictional character
                from a book or movie can help you with self-reflection and to be less critical of yourself. Certain
                podcasts or Ted Talks motivate you to live your life in a different, better way. Art is a medium that
                directly changes one's thoughts, mood, ideas and more. It’s a powerful force with the ability to
                influence huge masses. Regardless of this, most artists struggle to make ends meet, solely on the basis
                of their art.
                <br>
                <br>
                The struggle of choosing a creative career isn’t news. The lack of respect for artists has stemmed from
                the common belief that art doesn’t create value and is less significant than other major streams.
                Society’s poor conception of creative jobs and work results in artists being paid far less than their
                worth. This economic rift further reduces the respect artists have today. Artists are forced to choose
                socially and financially secure alternatives to their career.
                <br>
                <br>
                In addition to this, people don’t observe art enough to be able to understand the effort and time it
                takes. Abstract paintings are defined as ‘random splashes of paint’. Songs are just ‘lyrics strung
                together with the same tunes’. Using this kind of phrasing devalues the hard work that goes into it all.
                Being blind to the time, work or meaning of something makes people ignorant, leading to underestimation
                of artists.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Without external support, financial and social, it’s very difficult for artists to rise. In recent
                times, musicians have been raising their displeasure over the same. Mainstream media and influential
                figures promote popularity of the already well liked and recognised artists. The difference is so large
                that artists with over 500k listeners are considered ‘underrated’. The compensation received per stream
                on all streaming sites is extremely low. There are no provisions to promote a struggling artist without
                them having to put a big dent in their pockets.

                For a lot of artists, producing their art is hardly about money, fame, or success. But passion can only
                take you so far. Relying on their art, regardless of how good it might be, proves to be insufficient to
                earn a living. Small things we listeners can do for them go a long way. The simple act of sharing their
                music, engaging with their music in the form of likes and comments or making playlists and adding their
                songs helps them increase their reach.

                Here at Aural, we are trying to make a platform as creator friendly as possible. Our platform aims to
                reduce, if not eliminate, the main struggles of our artists in various ways.
                <br>
                <br>
                1. Eliminating an ‘administration fee’ that artists must pay in order to have their content published.
                Creators are free to upload and promote their content free of cost. The uploading process is short and
                easy too. All that’s needed to be done is provide a title, description, and an image to go with your
                content. Getting their work published on a public platform takes no additional effort or labour, as we
                believe it should always be.
                <br>
                <br>
                2. The hassle to create background images, cover art or a video to go with your music is not convenient
                for all artists. This poses a problem as music without conventionally aesthetically pleasing art or
                videos tend to not gain enough traction. Aural comes with a huge range of images assorted according to
                genre. Creators are free to choose from this large selection of images and upload their content with a
                tap.
                <br>
                <br>
                3. The biggest problem faced by artists is not having their content reach their target audience. Aural
                solves the disparity in reach with our algorithm that shows the user the best suited post. The algorithm
                shows no variance between artists based on their follower count, popularity, region, etc. With Aural,
                you can be sure to reach an audience. No matter where you stand, your skill and Aural will take you
                forward.
                <br>
                <br>
                Are you an artist looking for a realistic and viable platform? Or an enthusiast looking to explore new
                tunes? If yes, then Aural’s the right choice for you. The app is ready and you can reach out to us to
