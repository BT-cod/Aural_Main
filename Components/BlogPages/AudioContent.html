                <span class="custom-letter">T</span>he term "audio content" refers to any published or distributed
                information that is listened to. A wide range of audio-based entertainment and marketing materials, such
                as podcasts, audiobooks, and AI voice assistant abilities or actions, fall under this category. Computer
                speakers, headphones, and smart speakers may all be used to play audio content.
            </p>
            <img src="/Components/BlogImages/blog17.png" alt="blog" />
            <h3>Why are so many people switching to it?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Audio Content may be consumed while driving or doing other tasks, whereas visual or textual material is
                not. Three methods are often used to create it:
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                1. Using genuine human voices to record.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                2. Natural language processing (NLP) is used to turn written information into speech.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                3. The ability of smart speakers or other voice-activated devices to recognize orders given to them
                orally.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                It is impossible to dismiss the necessity of adding audio-based content into business since audio usage
                has steadily increased. A company's narrative, culture, goal, or voice might be better communicated to
                prospective consumers via audio content. User experience (UX) and communication may both benefit from
                it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>It's great that audio content is so easy to consume since many of us have grown weary of the more visible
                types of marketing. Audiovisual material, on the other hand, requires viewers to keep their eyes on a
                screen..
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Listening to audio content on the move is possible whether they're driving, making a meal, or taking
                their dog for a walk. It's changing the way we all multitask.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Speakers and headphones are the most common means by which we hear sounds. Recently, audio content
                marketing has had a renaissance because of advancements in various audio technologies, such as Bluetooth
                connections and smart speaker systems. Rather than relying on our smartphones, we may ask Alexa to do
                the job. As a friend and personal assistant all in one, audio content and technology is hard to beat.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>It's easy to see that the use of audio as a means of communication predates the necessity for reading and
                writing by decades. Since the dawn of time, we've relied on sound to communicate with one another. As a
                result, this structure has become second nature to us without our even realizing it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>On-page SEO may benefit from audio content as well. Podcasts and other audio material will now be served
                in Google search results, according to a company announcement made in May 2019. Audio blogging is one of
                the alternatives. To improve your site's bounce rate and average time spent stats, you may need to
                rethink how you're displaying your information.</p>
            <h3>Types of audio content</h3>
            <br>
            <h4><u>Podcasts</u></h4>
            <br>
            <p>• During the past decade, podcasts have gone from being a platform for unknown comedians and independent
                bands to becoming a refuge for A-list celebrities and giant corporations to promote their products.
                <br>
                <br>
                • Successfully branded podcasts include those from McDonald's, eBay, and Microsoft.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4><u>Audiobooks</u></h4>
            <br>
            <p>It's difficult to stand out in the crowded field of podcasting and radio. However, the audiobook market
                is
                far less crowded, making it simpler for new authors to get their work out there.</p>
            <br>
                <h4><u>Editorial</u></h4>
            <br>
            <p>Your articles are becoming audio content as smart speakers like Alexa, Siri, and Cortana become more
                popular.</p>
            <br>
            <h4><u>Social Audio</u></h4>
            <br>
            <p>• In the social media sphere, audio is beginning to speak for itself. Businesses can interact with
                customers on a personal level thanks to audio content, which is both easy to use and accessible.
                Listeners may access the station either at work or on the go.
                <br>
                <br>
                • As a result, combining the power of social media with it feels like a logical progression. This is
                where Aural is making its mark, it’s revolutionizing the way we hear and share audio, it’s a platform
                where people can express their talents, and their emotions in the form of audio content, and with its
                multiple features such as Spices and Tunes, it becomes a highly interactive social audio application. It
                also emphasizes the motto “Make Yourself Heard” by creating a safe space or environment for the people
                who aren’t that comfortable with revealing their faces or who’d like to stay anonymous.
            </p>
            <h3>Audio Content taking over India</h3>
            <br>
            <p>As worldwide podcasts and audio platforms direct their focus to India, the nation is now starting to
                witness an increase in consumers for digital content. According to forecasts, India is expected to reach
                95 million active monthly users (MAUs) by the end of 2021.</p>
            <br>
            <p>According to a market research company Red Seer, the number of people listening to podcasts, audiobooks,
                and other audio-based entertainment content is up 34% from the 71 million people who did so last year.
                According to the business, just 12% of Indians have "ever listened to a podcast," indicating that an
                "immense possibility for development" exists</p>
            <br>
            <p>In 2021, Indians are expected to spend 2,290 billion minutes online 2021. Messages, OTT video, news
                aggregation applications, and short video platforms made up the next 885 billion minutes of user time,
                followed by social media (885 billion minutes). In October, podcasts accounted for 2.5 billion minutes
                of internet time.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Spotify, the worldwide streaming service, reported "notable traction" in its third-quarter earnings
                report "India and Latin America for original podcasts There is a claim that it is among the most popular
                podcasts in India.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Red Seer’s analysis isn't the first to forecast a significant increase in such material. According to the
                company after the epidemic, KPMG predicted that podcasts would be one of the most important listening
                trends to keep an eye on a 23% increase in podcast listening when COVID-19 forced people inside.</p>
